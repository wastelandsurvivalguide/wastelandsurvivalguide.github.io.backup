# Final Steps

Click the ![MO2 folder button](./img/mo2%20folders.webp) button at the top of MO2 and select
**Open Profile Folder**. Extract `loadorder.txt` from the [WSG load order archive](./dl/WSG%20Load%20Order.7z)
and place it in the opened folder. Press F5 to refresh MO2 and if everything went correctly, the final plugin
in MO2's right pane should be **`DN Weathers.esp`**. Click the **Backup** button so if something ever goes wrong
you can instantly restore this load order:
