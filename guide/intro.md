## About the Guide

Wasteland Survival Guide is a customizable, modular modding guide for Tale of Two Wastelands.
The core of the guide - everything up to and including the [Utilities](utilities) section -
focuses on stability and performance and should be completed by everyone.

Everything _past_ that point is included for the purposes of customization, and you can skip any
mods (or entire sections) at your leisure. When you are done installing mods, no matter how many
you chose to install or skip, you must also complete the [Final Steps](finish) section.

:::info Continuing from _The Best of Times_?

If you are continuing from the official [**TTW Installation Guide**](https://thebestoftimes.github.io/),
you should start this guide at the [Utilities](utilities) section. You should already have
nearly everything there with the exception of **AnhNVSE**.
