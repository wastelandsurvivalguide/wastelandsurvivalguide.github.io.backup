# Animations

:::caution A Word About Animation Replacers

Some of these mods can affect game balance by differing from vanilla attack speed and reload
speed values. They can also be distracting and may look strange at high agility and/or with
Rapid Reload perk. You may also encounter misaligned ironsights which can be fixed by
following the instructions on the [ISControl Enabler](#iscontrol-enabler) Nexus page.
