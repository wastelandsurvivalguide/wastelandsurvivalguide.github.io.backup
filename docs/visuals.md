## **Visuals**

### **First, create a "Visuals"  in MO2.**
##### **As you install the mods from this section, organize them underneath this separator.**
If you are curious about/disappointed by the lack of texture mods in this section, the WSG team doesn't really use texture mods & they are generally compatible with everything, so for that reason they are considered outside of the scope of the guide. If you are interested in texture packs, [here is a texture guide](https://salamand3r.fail/texture-guide) contributed by **Salamand3r** to help you get started. No support is provided for these textures, but do enjoy.
