# [**Wasteland Survival Guide**](./index.html)

## **A Tale of Two Wastelands 3.3.2 Modding Guide**
Wasteland Survival Guide is a customizable, modular modding guide for TTW aimed at providing a stable and bug-free experience, as well as recommending a curated selection of working, up-to-date optional mods for customization. While everything up to the end of the **Utilities** section is required, the rest of the mods in the guide are optional. You can skip any you don't wish to use and the load order provided in the **Finish** section will still work.

If you are continuing from [**The Best of Times**](https://thebestoftimes.github.io/) (the official TTW installation guide), you should start this guide at the [Utilities](./utilities.html) section. Most of the mods in that section you will already have, however you should update/add whatever you are missing, which currently should include **AnhNVSE & yGTM**.

This guide uses [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194) **exclusively**. Its steps specifically pertain to MO2 and cannot be completed on Vortex or any other mod manager. **Support will only be provided for MO2**.
## **Requirements - You NEED all of these before continuing!**
- **English** copies of both Fallout 3 and New Vegas with **all DLCs** on either Steam or GOG.
  - GoTY/Ultimate edition is **not** a factor so long as you have all of the DLCs for both games.
  - You may "mix and match" Steam and GOG versions; e.g. FO3 on GOG and FNV on Steam is supported.
  - Bethesda.net and Game Pass versions are not supported and won't be due to fundamental incompatibility with xNVSE.
