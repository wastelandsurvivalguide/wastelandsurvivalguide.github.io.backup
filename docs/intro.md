# Intro
## **About the Guide**
Wasteland Survival Guide is a customizable, modular modding guide for Tale of Two Wastelands. While the first few sections of the guide are mandatory for a stable game, everything **after** the Utilities section can be considered optional. When you are done installing mods, no matter how many you chose to install, make sure to complete the Final Steps section.

If you are continuing from [**The Best of Times**](https://thebestoftimes.github.io/) (the official TTW installation guide), you should start this guide at the [Utilities](./utilities.html) section. Most of the mods in that section you will already have, however you should update/add whatever you are missing, which currently should include **AnhNVSE & yGTM**.

This guide uses [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194) **exclusively**. Its steps specifically pertain to MO2 and cannot be completed on Vortex or any other mod manager. **Support will only be provided for MO2**.
