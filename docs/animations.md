## **Animations**

### **First, create an "Animations" [separator](./img/mo2 separator.png) in MO2.**
##### **As you install the mods from this section, organize them underneath this separator.**
Using animation replacers like the ones on this page can affect the balance of the game by making attacks and reloads take a different amount of time compared to vanilla. They may also look strange when combined with the Rapid Reload perk, may be distracting, etc.
