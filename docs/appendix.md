List of mods that cannot be used with Tale of Two Wastelands - very important to review. Be aware the list is not exhaustive.
##### [**Performance Guide for FNV](https://wallsogb.github.io/FalloutNV-Performance-Guide/)** 
In-depth information about how to optimize the game's performance covering topics such as DXVK and fullscreen VS windowed mode.
##### [**Viva New Vegas - Resources](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/resources.html)** 
Various Guides and information that will be useful, especially if you plan on adding mods. The **Tools to Avoid** & **Mods to Avoid** links are especially recommended reads as they apply equally to TTW. Ignore the LOD Guide from VNV since WSG has its own.
##### [**Video Install Guide by Cloudisms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb9e4-NDOTM)**.**
For the more visual learners: an excellent video installation guide for TTW. A [Short & Concise Install](https://youtu.be/gVJtF-sdu0s) video is also available, as well as a video on how to [Update TTW](https://youtu.be/PMWzD_ZwcrI).
