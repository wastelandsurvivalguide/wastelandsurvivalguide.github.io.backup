# Tale of Two Wastelands

In this step, we will install and activate Tale of Two Wastelands through Mod Organizer 2.

If you run into any errors when installing, check the [FAQ](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/faq) to see if it has the solution.

1. Make sure both Mod Organizer 2 and the game are closed.
1. From the [TTW Download](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/dl) page, download the **3.3.2 Installer** file.
1. Extract the contents of the **3.3.2 Installer** archive to a new folder called **TTW Installer** in a safe location outside of any default Windows folders.
1. Once everything has been extracted, open MO2, select the  button at the top, and select **Open Mods folder**, and create a folder there named **Tale of Two Wastelands**.
1. Back in the **TTW Installer** folder, right-click the **TTW Install.exe** and select **Run As Administrator**.
1. In the installer, verify that the automatically set file paths for both your Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas installations are correct.
1. Set the Tale of Two Wastelands install path to the C:\Users\**YOUR USERNAME**\AppData\Local\ModOrganizer\TTW\mods\Tale of Two Wastelands you created in step 4.



1. Ensure your paths look similar to the example above, then select **Install**.

The install may take a long time as the .ogg encoding is very CPU-intensive. It takes about 40 minutes on my 5600x but could take several hours or even longer on a slower CPU.
It is recommended to leave your computer alone and have any CPU-intensive applications closed during this install to reduce the likelihood of installation errors
### **Activating TTW in Mod Organizer 2**
9. Launch Mod Organizer 2
9. If you installed TTW properly with the correct filepaths, you should see the **Tale of Two Wastelands** mod in the left pane of MO2.
   1. If you do not see anything, you did not install TTW to the correct folder. Find out where the files were installed to and move them to 
      C:\Users\**YOUR USERNAME**\AppData\Local\ModOrganizer\TTW\mods\Tale of Two Wastelands
9. Click the checkbox next to it in the left pane, and the right pane should fill with plugins.
### **Installing the Hotfix**
12. Download the [3.3.2 Hotfix](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/267355049666019329/1003041304252534814/TTW_3.3.2_Hotfix.zip).
12. Install it normally in MO2, renaming appropriately if prompted, and drag it below **Tale of Two Wastelands** in the left pane.

If you don't know how to install a mod that isn't from Nexus, refer to the [Mod Installation Advice](./mo2.html#advice) section again.

12. Click the checkbox next to it in the left pane to activate it.
